**additional comments**:

- introduction                                                          (0/1)
    - kind of non-existent
    - way too short and realistically didn't go over anything
- generating itinerary                                                  (2/3)
    - works fine
    - colour choice is a little questionable
        - specifically the black on dark purple
    - modifying the itinerary once it's made is a little awkward
        - "get new place" seems a little too random and not very useful
        - can't remove items from the itinerary once created
- sharing itinerary                                                     (1/3)
    - some graphical glitches
    - looked like it almost crashed the application
    - does work but is not useful
        - when it goes to the other user, is just text
            - can't see routing; can't modify the itinerary; can't interact with it; ...
- directions                                                            (2/3)
    - works fine
    - only works from one location to the previous location
        - does not come up with a route from the start to end while including all locations

## software architecture

**total mark**: 5/10

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|architecture presented clearly, illustrated with sufficient diagrams, responsibilities shown clearly||4|
|technologies presented clearly, illustrated with sufficient diagrams/links/examples, technical challenges indicated clearly||6|

**additional comments**:

- architecture:                                                         (2/4)
    - diagram is fine
    - explanations were mostly just reading off of the slides
        - explanations didn't go into too much detail
        - some of your components are not really useful to go over
            - e.g. the `PageNotFound` component is just an error; we don't need to see this
- technologies:                                                         (3/6)
    - went over but didn't explain why they chose these technologies
        - did you have prior experience? did someone tell you to use these?
        - why did you choose to use Angular when you didn't have prior experience with it?
- challenges:
    - challenges were fine but solutions were vague and overly general
        - you could essentially answer "we did more research / we watched some videos" for any challenge
