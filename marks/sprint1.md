## planning meetings

**total mark**: 2/5

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|RPM.md is well documented|1|3|
|sprint1.md is well documented|1|2|

**additional comments**:

- release goals are not explicitly specified
    - user stories to be completed during release are specified but specific goals are not defined
- task breakdown isn't totally clear
    - want a bit more elaboration on who is going to be doing what as opposed to just who is going to do which tasks in the backlog
    - some tasks don't have anyone assigned to them yet are stated in to be done this sprint
        - namely PLAN-2 and PLAN-13
    - not every subtask has someone assigned to it

## user stories

**total mark**: 9/10

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|correctly formulated user stories|1|2|
|recorded on JIRA|2|2|
|broken down into tasks|2|2|
|estimated stories and point values are recorded on JIRA|2|2|
|all stories are prioritized|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- user stories are not referencing specific personas
    - this was not fixed from sprint 0
- for future sprints, use JIRA's estimation functionality as opposed to just writing the story point estimation in the description
    - this will make it easier for me to mark as well

**additional comments**:

        - make sure everyone is assigned approximately the same amount of story points

## system design

**total mark**: 8/10

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|cover page and table of contents|2|2|
|CRC cards|4|4|
|software architecture design|2|4|

**additional comments**:

- software architecture design diagram is a little lacking
    - was looking for a diagram that encompasses your entire application (i.e. frontend / backend / data stores)
    - was not looking for a UML diagram
- diagram is not really following an MVC architecture
