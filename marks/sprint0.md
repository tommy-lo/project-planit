## competition.md

**total mark**: 1/2

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|competition has been identified clearly|1|2|

**additional comments**:

- some descriptions are little lacking; additionally some competition shortcomings are a little shoehorned
    - examples:
        - _our app is better for users who don't want a lot of popups when visiting the site and want a simple experience_
            - how are you going to accomplish this? what is a simple experience?
            - ads are not really a shortcoming; does tripadvisor have flaws in the UI which make it difficult to use? you can block ads with an adblocker
        - _our product provides a more indepth customization to a user's needs_
            - how is it going to do this?
- try to consider things that your competitors aren't doing well and try to come up with solutions which you can implement in your product
