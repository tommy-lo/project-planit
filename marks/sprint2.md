## planning meetings

**total mark**: 4/5

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|`SR1.md` is well documented|1|2|
|`sprint2.md` is well documented|3|3|

**additional comments**:

- `SR2.md` should be labelled `SR1.md`
    - sprint 2 hasn't ended yet; you should be reviewing the end of sprint 1
- `SR1.md`:
    - a lot of things are kind of vague and could use some more explanation
        - best/worst experiences:
            - only listed one experience and didn't label it to be "bad" or "good"
        - harmful practices:
            - "make sure whole demo works ahead of time" is not a harmful practice
                - this is the sign of a larger issue
                    - ensure code is stable next time?
                    - why did the demo fail this time? what things could we change to make it not fail?
        - every time you list a new suggestion or something you did wrong, provide reasons for why the new suggestion will help or how you are going to mitigate what you did wrong before

**additional comments**:

- PLAN-11 not started but reasonable explanation was given
- task distribution is generally pretty equal but make sure that some people aren't taking a significantly higher amount of tasks than others
- work is generally pretty continuous; very slightly skewed towards the end of the week
- everyone needs to contibute to the daily standup
    - even if you have no update, state that said person had no update
    - same with no update around the board; state that no one had any updates
