Sprint 3 Backlog Breakdown:

Plan-43, 47, 9, 48, 49 Thomas Lo

Doing those plans since they have to do with a google maps api and they are all related to each other in using that api.

Plan-2, 26, 27, 40, 50 Joon Hong
More familiar with database to get the user history


Plan-39,44,45 Kia Naderi


Doing those plans because he worked on the itinerary in sprint1 as well as sprint2 so the plan for designing the screen will be similar to his other task the redirecting of website and sending long and lat to direstions api will involve info from the api he has used for iten. 

Plan-17, 51, 52, 14, 53, 54, 41, 42, 46 Brandon Shewnarain

Doing those plans because he worked on routing in previous sprints and also worked on interacting with the mongodb in previous sprints. Also is used to creating pages/modifying html in pages.

Plan-12,24,25 Anson

Doing those plans because they involve personalized filters which is on a different page so they all are simlilar.

Plan-11 Not implemented due to the api not supporting it's function
