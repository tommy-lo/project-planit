What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:

Team meetings to resolve conflicts in code/get a better understanding of each others work.

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:

Meet more often in person to compare our code/github merges. By doing this we will get a better understanding of what others have worked on and get a head start on having a completed product done for the next sprint interview and not potentially scramble to fix anything during the tutorial.

Harmful practices to stop using during next sprint:

Not updating standups daily because team members need to be updated on what other members have done/are doing. To remedy this we would try to make everyone update their standup by the end of the day so that we can all have a better understanding of where they are at instead of figuring it out during our whatsapp meeting every week or so.

Best/worst experience during sprint 3:

Merging (worst) because merging code together can take a lot of time especially when you don’t know the whole codebase.

Seeing product in action (best) because it’s the product that was imagined at the start of the project .
