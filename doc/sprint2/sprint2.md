--- [PLAN-2 and PLAN-12] was not started in this task because it depends on the completion of PLAN-13(generating itinerary). We initially planned on finishing PLAN-13 and then start working on [PLAN-2 and PLAN-12] but this did not work out because we were not very familiar with angular and integrating google places API into our app turned out to be quite difficult. For instance, we first tried google places API as sending an https request and tried to get a response but we encountered lots of errors mainly CORS (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) then we had to move to use google places library to get it to work.
