  High being dedicated to main features that make up the core functionality and are the building blocks for other functionality. Generally   speaking these are the tasks that should be done first. In other words these functionalities are the essence of our project without them   the project would not serve its primary purpose.
  
  Medium being features that will distinguish the app from other similar apps but are not essential for the functionality of the app.
  Low being additional features that don’t add core functions but extras that can increase satisfaction for users. These features can only   be added once main features are working.
  
  Point 1 5 exponential power of 2 1 being the time it takes to do the smallest part of the project.
