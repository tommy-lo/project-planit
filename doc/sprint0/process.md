• How did you make decisions? 
  Firstly we preseneted an issue or topic then we did a brainstorming session where different solutions were presented. Once a logical
  solution was given we put it to vote and asked everyone to give a (Yes/No) vote and an explantion for why they feel the way they do.
  There were instances when we realized a solution was not good enough, which forced us to brainstorm again. This process was repeated
  till we found a reasonable solution that everyone agreed on.
  
• How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? 
  Priority was low, medium, or high. 
  
  High being dedicated to main features that make up the core functionality and are the building blocks for other functionality.
  Generally speaking these are the tasks that should be done first. In other words these functionalities are the essence of our project
  without them the project would not serve its primary purpose.
  
  Medium being features that will distinguish the app from other similar apps but are not essential for the functionality of the app.
  
  Low being additional features that don’t add core functions but extras that can increase satisfaction for users. These features can
  only be added once main features are working.
  
  1 point is dedicated to the amount of work needed to complete the smallest part of the project(Smallest task).
  From there each point requires twice as much work. 5 is the highest point given and it requires 16 times the work needed to complete
  the smallest task.
