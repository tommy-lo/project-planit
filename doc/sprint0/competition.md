Plans whole trip and offers things to do and a side trip to do for each destination.
Activities to do aren’t very specific to someone’s or a group's interests, the site only gives a list of them with a korating.
Our product provides an in depth event planner catered to the user’s needs and interest rather than planning their whole trip from start to end and just offering hotspots to visit. Users would enter their preferences and we would narrow down what they would like and plan it for them.
Our product would be better for users who have a hard time deciding on something they would like to do while visiting. A family might enjoy baseball rather than golf so we can narrow down and recommend that they visit Rogers Centre for a baseball game. The product would also recommend more appropriate suggestions rather than just a list of things to do such as a family getting recommended to go to a theme park rather than a bar.
Most likely didn’t focus on these users/scenarios due to its main purpose being a broader trip planner which doesn’t need to account to individual needs or interests. They would need  to add filters to narrow down what people should do.

Plans whole trip and gives suggestions to what to do in the area.
Our product provides a more indepth customization to a user's needs rather than just list what kind of types of sightseeing they might be into and suggestions.
Our app is better for users who don't want a lot of popups when visiting the site and want a simple experience.
TripAdvisor could fix this by having a sub site where they just go in depth with their planning rather than the whole trip.
